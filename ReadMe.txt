This program allows you to control your PC's mouse and keyboard via voice controls, entirely based on pitch and volume. You'll need a microphone for this to work. Try to put the images in the same folder/directory as the exe (program) file.

Included are 3 different modes - one for controlling just your mouse (as a full replacement to a mouse with L/R clicking, scrolling, and dragging),
one for controlling your mouse and keyboard (in the context of a first-person-shooter (FPS) game, and finally one that is the same as the FPS version 
but without any of the mouse movement (for if you already have a way to use a mouse like a head mouse). There's diagrams of each control scheme inside
the program. As of writing this I'm not sure how useful this program will be, but at the least it could be a great temporary/low cost solution for people 
with disabilites preventing them from using their hands. Or just a fun thing to mess around with.

Here's what the variables do if it's unclear:
	>>Sensativity = how sensative the mouse is (how fast it moves)
	>>Low Volume = the threshold for what constitutes silence
	>>Middle Volume = the point at which moving your mouse goes from moving up to down or vice versa (the midpoint of the graph)
	>>High Volume = the loudness threshold to perform the high-volume action (depends on what version you're using)
	>>Very Low Pitch, Low Pitch = how low you have to "sing" to perform the very low action or low action, respectively
	>>Middle Pitch = the threshold for when your mouse goes from moving left to right or vice versa
	>>High Pitch, Very High Pitch = how high you have to "sing" to perform the very high or high action, respectively
